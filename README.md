# 100 Days of Code

My main goal with this challenge is to practice my consistency. The knowledge I will gain is an extra side effect. I hope to Learn enough Python to be dangerous, solidify my javascript knowledge, and become an all around better developer.

This means improving my git knowledge, practicing terminal commands, learnng REgex, learn to write tests and any other gem of knowledge I may come across.

## Day 1 - current

Starting off with a 4 hour beginners Python course I found on YouTube by Free Code Camp.

- Day 1:
  Today I learned about strings and some simple string manipulation.

  Cool fact: When a backslash "\" is typed within a string it serves as an escape character used to indicate other special characters such as new lines (\n) or quotation marks (\").

- Day 2:
  Today I learned about list functions.

  Python has a bunch of built in list or array functions that are extremely useful. Coming from JavaScript some of these were familiar but tuples were new to me.

  Tuples are like arrays but are immutable meaning they cannot be changed.

- Days 3 & 4:
  I was introduced to functions and if else statements in Python. Most of it was familiar just learning the syntax.

  I really like how simple and clean Python's syntax is. No brackets for functions, the containing code is just indented.

- Day 5:
  Today I learned about loops. While loops and for loops.

  For loops know in advance how many times it will loop, where a while loop doesnâ€™t know. For loop initializes and increments a variable as part of the for loop structure. While loops must have it's variable initialized before the loop and is incremented inside the loop body.

- Day 6:
  Today I learned about file handling in python.

  Some key points:
  - If you open a file you have to close it at some point.
  - The first parameter in the open function is the file you wish to open.
  - The second parameter is the mode you wish to open the file in.

  Pythons simple syntax is really showing me how powerful this language is.

- Day 7:
  Today I made a simple calculator with python.

  Python's input function is really powerful. I was able to prompt the user, convert the user's response to a number and store it in a variable all in one line of code.

  I'm really having a lot of fun with Python!

- Day 8:
  Today I worked with some of Python's built in math functions.

  I'm realizing that Python's greatest strength is in its simplicity.

- Day 9:
  Today is not python related but I brushed up on some terminal commands.
  
  Learning the command line will save me tons of time in my day to day life. It also unlocks the true power of the computer.

- Day 10:
  Today I learned about modules in Python. Modules are files that contain code that can be imported and used in your files.

  NumPy is as external module I installed using pip.

  Pip is a package manager used for installing external modules.

- Day 11:
  Today I learned about classes and objects in Python.

  Classes give a lot of versitility to programming. They define the shape or structure of an object.

  Objects take of the attributes of a class but they contain actual data.

- Day 12 & 13:
  I decided to take codewars for a spin and practice my problem solving.

  This problem helped me learn some string methods like the count method. Had I known this method, my xo function could have been alot shorter.

  The count method takes in a parameter such as a letter and returns how many times it occurs in the string it was called upon.

- Day 14:
  Decided to take on another problem from code wars. This one was inspired by Project Euler.

  The key to this function is the modulus "%" operator, it returns the remainder after the division of two numbers.

  Again, I could have written this function in one line.

- Day 15 & 16:
  Spent the last couple days working on a code wars challenge I wasn't confident I could solve.

  What helped me here was just breaking the problem down into smaller more manageable steps. It's a process most programmers use so solve problems.

  Hopefully as I become a better programmer my solutions will be more efficient.

- Day 17:
  I've been stumped these last few days on a hacker rank coding challenge. Getting stuck definitely has a way of killing your confidence so I'm focusing on the positive. Even though I can't solve a problem doesn't mean I'm not learning. Heres a couple of things I've learned in my attempts.

  I've learned about lambda functions whichare annomous functions. When used the the list methods, map, filter, and reduce, it allows you to perform a function on each item in the list and return a new array.

  I've also learned about list comprehension, which almost does the same thing but it returns a new array based on a conditional arguent.

  I think its time to start a project and see if that sparks my passion again.
