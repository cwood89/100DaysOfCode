Day 14
.
Decided to take on another problem from code wars. This one was inspired by Project Euler.
.
The key to this function is the modulus "%" operator, it returns the remainder after the division of two numbers.
.
Again, I could have written this function in one line.

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
