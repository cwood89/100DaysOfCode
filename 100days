Day 10
.
Today I learned about modules in Python. Modules are files that contain code that can be imported and used in your own files.
.
NumPy is an external module I installed using pip. Pip is a package manager used for installing external modules.
.
Python comes with a ton of built in modules but there are even more external modules written by other developers.

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
