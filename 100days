Day 1

Took a few day off to decompress, it's tough fitting in coding with everything else life throws at you. Because of that I'm starting over at day one.

Decided to start working on automating my instagram posts. I did some research and learned about Selenium. Selenium is a program that allows users to programmatically use the browser. Mainly it is used for testing but it's perfect for what I need.

The only issue I had was when I ran Selenium it would open up the browser window so, the first thing figured out was how to run the web driver headless, or without the window.

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
