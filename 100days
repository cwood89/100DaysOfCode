Day 12 & 13
.
I decided to take codewars for a spin and practice my problem solving.
.
This problem helped me learn some string methods like the count method. Had I known this method, my xo function could have been alot shorter.
.
The count method takes in a parameter such as a letter and returns how many times it occurs in the string it was called upon.

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
