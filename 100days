Day 14 & 15
.
Spent the last couple days working on a code wars challenge I wasn't confident I could solve.
.
What helped me here was just breaking the problem down into smaller more manageable steps. It's a process most programmers use so solve problems.
.
Hopefully as I become a better programmer my solutions will be more efficient.

CONSISTENCY

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
