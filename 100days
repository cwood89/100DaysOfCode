Day 17
.
I've been stumped these last few days on a hacker rank coding challenge. Getting stuck definitely has a way of killing your confidence so I'm focusing on the positive. Even though I can't solve a problem doesn't mean I'm not learning. Heres a couple of things I've learned during my attempts.
.
I've learned about lambda functions whichare annomous functions. When used the the list methods, map, filter, and reduce, it allows you to perform a function on each item in the list and return a new array.
.
I've also learned about list comprehension, which almost does the same thing but it returns a new array based on a conditional argument.
.
I think its time to start a project and see if that sparks my passion again.

Today I learned that there are two kinds of functions.
.
Fruitful functions, which return a value and void functions which primarily perform an action they always return a special dummy value of none.
